                        For as long as I’ve known him, Jonatan has been talking about writing a book. He says he could never write it himself, but he wants to find someone to interview him and write down his life story.

                        This week, we’re continuing the story of Jonatan, the man who inspired the creation of Status. This week, hear the story of how Lori & David became Mom & Dad.

                    <p>
                        By the time he was in college, Jonatan was living what could be considered a picturesque American life. There were just two things that might take it away from him. His big secret and what came in the mail.

                    <h2>Re-Entry (Jonatan, Part 4)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Jonatan found a new home and a new family in the United States. Then he was told he had to return to Colombia. But it wasn’t as easy as showing up and starting to work. He had to rebuild a life there.

                        Jonatan was the impetus for Status. This is the final part of his story. Hear how he and I met, fell for each other, and worked to maintain that love. And we learn once again that even in the most straightforward of cases, immigration gets messy.

                    <p>
                        Eddie entered the US through customs at 14, and he doesn’t remember much about it. He was more interested in seeing his mom who was being treated for cancer.
                        Then he met Tyler, and all of a sudden it was on him to prove exactly what he didn’t say on a random day in 2002.
